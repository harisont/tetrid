# Tetrid

## What

A variant of the classic Tetris game with GitHub identicons instead of tetrominoes and a slightly different gameplay in order to keep it fun.

## Who

This game is inspired to [this wonderful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Tq0vfiLzn8c), made by [frabulous](https://github.com/orgs/Disorganizzazione/people/frabulous) to celebrate the completion of an ambitious group project. The shapes used in the games are the ones of the members of [Disorganizzazione](https://github.com/Disorganizzazione), i.e. the participants in such project, plus [tsigemit](https://github.com/tsigemit)'s one.

## Why

Why tsigemit? Because this game was originally written by the two of us as a Functional Programming assignment.

## Where and when

 GÃ¶teborg, december 2018.

## How (to run the game)

If run as indicated below, tetrid is a terminal game (which is quite cool actually).

The game could potentially run in a web browser as well (via codeworld), but that sucks because codeworld sucks, the graphics are ugly and it's not even online, but you can try at your own risk.

### Linux

Unless you have a Haskell installation and are willing to compile `Tetris.hs` on your own:

1. Download the latest version of the frozen binary
2. Move inside the folder containing the file
3. Run `chmod +x tetrid`
4. Run `./tetrid` of course

### Mac

Should be the same in principle, but I have done no tests.

### Windows

One day I may compile the game for you, but consider changing OS in the meantime.
